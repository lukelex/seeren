#Seeren
The way we build and structure our Views are fundamentally wrong. Views should be composed of multiple `interdependent pieces`, or `components` if you will, that when assembled together will work as expected.

Seeren was built to support this idea and the process behind it. Where you should develop and test your view's look & feel, behavior and assertiveness, as units and later on put them together as whole.
